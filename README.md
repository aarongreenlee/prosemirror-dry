# prosemirror-dry

This ProseMirror plugin highlights repeated words in the text, snapped to the word boundary.  The "dry" here stands for [Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

I often find myself inadvertently re-using the same personal argot in a piece of writing, and this is a very blunt way to "see" this in a text editor as you're typing.
